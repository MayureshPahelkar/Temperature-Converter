# Temperature-Converter
This project allows users to enter a temperature value and convert it either from Celsius to Fahrenheit or from Fahrenheit to Celsius. When the user clicks the submit button, PHP performs the conversion, and the result is printed in a paragraph tag. The interface is built using HTML, styled using CSS, and the conversion logic is implemented in PHP.
